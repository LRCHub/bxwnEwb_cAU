I'm always trying to cure your ache
Without perceiving the reason was me

Our thoughts are embedded in words
But I cannot discover any absorption
Every single word that we intend to speak
Spreads the ocean in between while we lose our gravity
Waiting for the tides to calm the storm
And remind us of what we've sworn

Cause I would carry you through the darkest day of mine
To prove how hard I've tried

Like the blood in my arteries
I find myself in decay
Diverge without gravity
It doesn't feel like there are words left to say

Instead of entering the conflated path to follow
We stray and we digress
Our lungs will stay hollow as if they both collapsed

Together forsaken so far from belief
We find ourselves in the casualty
Rely on me, comply with my sincerity
Because I'm reaching for gravity

Like the blood in my arteries
I find myself in decay
Diverge without gravity
It doesn't feel like there are words left to say

I'd carry you through the darkest day of mine

I find myself in decay
We diverge without gravity
